# 🌟 Enjoy exploring the SystemVerilog RAM implementation!

This repository contains a synthesizable RTL design of a Random Access Memory (RAM) module developed in SystemVerilog.

### 🚀 Key Features:

**Parameterized Configuration:** Flexible configurations for data width and address width.  
**Read and Write Operations:** Supports simultaneous read and write operations.  
**Simple and Efficient:** Designed for easy integration and efficient memory access.  

### 📁 Repository Structure:

📂 rtl: Contains the SystemVerilog RTL code for the RAM module.
📂 tests: Includes testbenches and test cases for functional verification.
📄 README.md: Documentation and usage instructions.
### 🛠️ Usage:

To instantiate the RAM module in your design, include the RTL file and configure the data and address widths according to your requirements.

### Running Tests:

Use the provided testbenches to verify the functionality of the RAM module. Detailed instructions available in the tests directory.
