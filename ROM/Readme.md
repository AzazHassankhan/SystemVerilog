# 📟 SystemVerilog ROM Implementation

This repository hosts a synthesizable Register-Only Memory (ROM) module designed in SystemVerilog.  

### 🚀 Key Features:

**Parameterized ROM:** Configurable data width and address width to suit various design needs.  
**Readable Only:** Supports read-only operations; designed for data retrieval based on address inputs.  
**Simple Integration:** Easy-to-use module for integrating read-only memory into your designs.  
### 📁 Repository Structure:

📂 rtl: Contains the SystemVerilog RTL code defining the ROM module.  
📂 tests: Houses testbenches and test cases for functional validation.  
📄 README.md: Documentation and usage guidelines.  
### 🛠️ Usage:

Integrate the ROM module into your design by including the RTL file and setting the desired data and address widths.   

### Testing:

Validate the ROM module's functionality using the provided testbenches in the tests directory. Detailed instructions included.
